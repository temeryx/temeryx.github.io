Website for Web Design for Everybody Capstone.

The four custom elements used on this site:  1) I used custom JavaScript to match the randomized picture on the homepage with correct hyperlink and alt tag. 2) I added a carousel for picturs. 3) I used a sticky footer. 4) I added a video background to one of the pages.    This is designed as a mobile first site, and uses media queries to be a responsive site.  Includes a prefers dark color scheme as well.

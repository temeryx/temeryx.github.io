        <h2>What is a Hobby Board Game?</h2>
        <p>"All of us who are enthusiastic about modern boardgames want to describe in an inspiring way to the unfamiliar what a modern boardgame is. And with limited time this task can be hard: To understand what they already know, to find out what we think they might like in boardgame so we can focus on that, to describe the the width, breadth and depth of the hobby, what to relate it to, what it's not or simply give the mysterious "Come and see"-answer. There should be as many ways to do this as there are human beings, I suppose".
